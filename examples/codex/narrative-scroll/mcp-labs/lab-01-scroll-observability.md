# Lab 01 — Scroll Observability Baseline

## Goal
Establish reproducible checkpoints for narrative section transitions.

## Procedure
1. Open `examples/codex/narrative-scroll/`.
2. Scroll from top to 25%, 50%, 75% page depth.
3. Record visible section label/transition behavior at each checkpoint.
4. Capture screenshots for each checkpoint.

## Expected Outcome
Section choreography exhibits deterministic progression tied to scroll depth bands.
