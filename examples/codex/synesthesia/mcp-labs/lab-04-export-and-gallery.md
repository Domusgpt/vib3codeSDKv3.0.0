# Lab 04 — Export and Gallery Workflow

## Goal
Practice saving, reloading, and exporting reproducible visual states.

## Tool Sequence
1. `save_to_gallery` with a descriptive label.
2. `list_gallery` and verify entry appears.
3. `load_from_gallery` by id/name.
4. `export_scene` to JSON.
5. Optional: `export_shader` and `export_trading_card`.

## Expected Outcome
Agents can hand off and restore exact states between sessions without re-deriving parameters.
