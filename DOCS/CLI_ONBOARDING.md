# Agentic CLI onboarding

This guide aligns the current CLI surface (package scripts and telemetry helpers) with an agentic workflow. It is intentionally explicit so automation agents and humans can share the same runbook.

## Prerequisites (tools to install)
- **Node.js 18.19+** (project engine requirement)
- **pnpm 9.4.0** (`corepack enable` then `corepack prepare pnpm@9.4.0 --activate`)
- Optional: **Storybook** support is baked into `pnpm storybook` once dependencies are installed.

## Baseline setup
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Daily dev commands
| Goal | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start the web playground | `pnpm dev:web` | Opens Vite dev server. |
| Build production bundle | `pnpm build:web` | Outputs `dist/`. |
| Lint core engine sources | `pnpm lint` | ESLint runs on `src/**/*.{js,ts}`. |
| Run tests | `pnpm test` | Runs Vitest in CLI mode. |
| Analyze bundle size | `pnpm analyze:bundle` | Vite build in analyze mode. |
| CI bundle check | `pnpm check:bundle` | Builds and runs size guard. |
| Storybook | `pnpm storybook` | Runs UI component workshop. |

## Telemetry export workflow (agentic)
1. **Prepare a pack** with `pack.scenes` (or `pack.states`) so preview generation has material.
2. **Call the telemetry director** (`js/core/telemetry-director.js`) to generate previews and manifest data:
   - `TelemetryDirector.generatePreviewSprites(pack, count)`
   - `TelemetryDirector.exportPack(pack, options)`
3. **Use the manifest pipeline** (`tools/telemetry/manifestPipeline.js`) to normalize metadata, compute hashes, and emit CLI-friendly summaries.
4. **Persist the results** in your export path along with hash summaries for CI and caching.

## Recommended agent checklist
- Confirm Node/pnpm versions match the project constraints.
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
- Run `pnpm lint` before export steps.
- Use telemetry hash summaries for diff checks and CI caching.
- Capture preview image artifacts if export tasks include visual outputs.
- Review [`DOCS/CONTROL_REFERENCE.md`](DOCS/CONTROL_REFERENCE.md) and be prepared to answer:
  - What geometry types are available in the engine?
  - Which parameters control each geometry type, and what are their control names?

## Troubleshooting
- If `pnpm` is missing, run `corepack enable` then re-run the install step.
- If telemetry previews fail in a browser context, ensure `TelemetryDirector` has a renderer that implements `captureFrame(scene)`.
