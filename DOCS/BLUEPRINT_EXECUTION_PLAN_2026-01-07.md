# Blueprint execution plan (2026-01-07)

This execution plan operationalizes the strategic blueprint and defines what each session should deliver. Each session should update `DOCS/SESSION_LOG_2026-01-07.md` with timestamped progress and keep the checklist current.

## Session cadence
- **Start of session**: review this plan and the strategic blueprint.
- **During session**: implement the next unchecked items, keep scope tight.
- **End of session**: update the session log with timestamped outcomes and any blockers.

## Execution checklist
### Phase 1 — Mathematical foundation
- [x] Add rotor/matrix utilities for the six rotation planes.
- [x] Implement stereographic + perspective projection helpers.
- [x] Add rotation drift/stability tests.

### Phase 2 — Rendering core consolidation
- [x] Define renderer contracts and resource manager interfaces.
- [ ] Unify visualization systems behind a shared scene graph.
- [ ] Document GPU disposal patterns and lifecycle hooks.

### Phase 3 — Agentic integration
- [x] Define MCP tools for create/apply/render workflows.
- [x] Emit structured telemetry spans and error schemas.
- [x] Implement CLI JSON output and non-interactive modes.

### Phase 4 — Cross-platform execution
- [ ] Define WASM build target and shared math core strategy.
- [ ] Add Flutter bindings with a batched render command buffer.
- [ ] Prototype WebGPU backend behind feature flags.

### Phase 5 — Production hardening
- [ ] Draft licensing tiers and activation workflow.
- [ ] Add export formats with golden snapshot tests.
- [ ] Document XR integration benchmarks and performance targets.
